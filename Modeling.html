                    Our modeling team worked to establish simulations in order to observe which modifications would be necessary to optimize our COP1-UVR8 system. We hope that these simulations provide a clearer picture for the specific protein-protein interactions that work to make our system elegant and efficient.

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
         Simulative modeling allows researchers to determine the prospective effects of their proposed system(s) without having to conduct live wet lab experiments. Throughout the course of the summer, we looked into modeling molecular dynamics (MD) to observe how the different components of our proposed kill switch would interact with one another. One program that  allowed us to go through with MD is called GROMACS. Mainly designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that are often involved in a series of complex  interactions, GROMACS allowed us to simulate and determine the interaction kinetics of the COP1-UVR8 system in both the active and inactive states. The main idea of these simulations was to observe what changes occurred in our model and gauge whether they would actually occur in a wet lab setting.

       <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <b> UVR8 dimer in water </b> </p>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">
   When first starting out, we decided that the best approach to MD was to simulate a UVR8 dimer alone in water. Furthermore, we set off to simulate some important amino acid residues, specifically Trp233/285. These two residues play important roles in dimer dissociation.

       <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <b> COP1 Mutagenesis </b> </p>
       <p style="font-size: 18px;">
         It was necessary to produce a UVR8-COP1 pair that did not interact with existing components of UV-B signaling pathways. To mitigate these interactions, a truncated COP1 was employed. This truncated COP1 contains only the WD40 domain critical for interaction with components of the UV-B signaling pathway, including UVR8. This abolishes the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of COP1 and with it a portion of its downstream signalling capacity. Further modifications were attempted to be investigated through this program.

           <hr class="hr">
           <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            To reinforce our predictive modeling approach, we began using a server for protein structure known as I-TASSER. Provided to us by the Zhang Lab from the University of Michigan, I-TASSER allows users to input primary structure strings of their proteins of interest and predicts both a secondary and tertiary structure for them.

           <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <b>Monomeric UVR8 </b></p>
           <p style="font-size: 18px;">
             We found that, surprisingly, there have been a lack of full length crystal structures of UVR8. So, homology models of the full length UVR8 were produced on I-TASSER. These homology models will be employed to examine how key motifs, namely the VP motif on the C27 extension and the corresponding residues on COP1, may be manipulated to preclude interaction with further components of the UV-B signaling pathway.
