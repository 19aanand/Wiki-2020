                After presenting our current approach to our advisors, Dr. Balazsi recommended that we read “Temporally Precise In-Vivo Control of Intracellular Signaling.” This paper discussed the use of optoXRs as a temporally precise way to control intracellular signaling pathways. This paper also helped us understand the difference between tonic and pulsatile modulation, and their impact on different physiological and pathological processes in a cell. Dr. Balazsi suggested that it would be beneficial to determine the effects of our system in basal and residual conditions. Basal conditions would denote the activity of our system with exposure to no light. Residual conditions, on the other hand, would denote the activity of our system after a certain period of light exposure. Because we cannot do this in a wet lab setting, we will likely work to model these activities.

                Since we want to integrate our project in the agriculture sector, it is very important for us to talk to professionals in this field. We reached out to HeartBeet Farms, a local organic farm on Long Island and spoke to the Co-Founder, Jennifer Ross. Jen spoke to our 2019 team about their work on Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), thus she was very familiar with iGEM and our team. During our meeting, she was very open to our questions and offered us her insightful opinion on our work.  When we asked her about indoor farms, Jen said that she doesn't mind that the agriculture sector is advancing. She pointed out that as a consumer and a human being, she cares more about how nutritious food is, rather than where it is grown. Our team had never thought about that. Jen Inspired us to ask indoor farms about the nutrition of their food. Another thing that Jen pointed out to us is that the reason she does not use GMOs is not necessarily because she is anti-GMO but rather that she does not have enough of the truth about GMOs. Our team felt that she was right, a lack of education does exist when it comes to GMOs. This encouraged us to think about ways we can easily teach the public about GMOs.

                A big portion of our project is dry lab, so we asked Dr. Balazsi for some prospective modeling approaches we should look into. Looking at our overview, Dr. Balazsi reiterated that we look into basal and residual conditions but in a more detailed light. With basal conditions, we could model the constant rate of RNA production in the dark to check for the dark activity of the proteins we are interested in. We also were taught that in a repressor system, there would be less leakage as we add more sites while in an activator system, there would be no way to control leakage. Another approach we would benefit from would be mitochondrial modeling. Here, we would be able to use ODEs to tell us about Bax levels over time as a function of light or promoter properties and then use cellular automata to tell us the effects of those Bax levels on the mitochondria. With these in mind, we decided that our design would be best supplemented with the following modeling approaches: nuclear shuttling of BphP1 from cytosol to nucleus in darkness and then light, threshold Bax oligomerization -- the lowest concentration of bax oligomers that guarantee cell death-- and ion diffusion (i.e. determining the effects on the levels of cytochrome c and it’s activation of the ROS pathway).
