  about one of the benefits that can come about through genetic engineering. </li>
    <li> We created a poster with Oneonta to display around campus to teach
    our school community about GMOs </li>
    <li> We pursued a partnership with MSP and others to peer-review each other's
      papers. This is extremely helpful because, through this, we were able
      to learn from each other's projects and something something </li>
