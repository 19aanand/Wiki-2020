  <li> We have created a an educational video with Ohio State University highlighting the benefits
  of biological killswitches and addressing common myths associated with GMOs. Through this,
  we hope to educate the community about the benefits that can come about through
  genetic engineering. </li>
  <li> We created a poster with Oneonta to display around campus to teach
  our school community about GMOs. Our poster's constitute facts about GMOs, etc. </li>
  <li> We pursued a collaboration with MSP and others to peer-review each other's
    papers. This is extremely helpful because, through this, we were able
    to learn from each other's projects and improve our skills in terms of communicating
    our work to the public </li>
  <li> We have also participated in many social media collaborations! For more information

  <ul>
    <li> We have met with many farmers and professors that have provided us
    with unique insights. Their advice allowed us to improve our
  approach and design so it is best suited for the environment when implemented.
  We also learned that many people are hesitant to support GMOs due to the fact that there is
  a lack of transparency between the scientific community and the general public. We also
  learned that farmers do not use GMOs because they are scary, but rather because
  their consumers prefer eating organic products. Because of this, our team has decided to
  put a large focus on establishing education initiatives to lessen the divide between scientists
  and the general public, which can be found in the Education page. For more information on
  the farmers and professors we contacted, please visit our Human Practices page </li>

  <ul>
    <li> We hope to implement our project into vertical farms and greenhouses.
      With the level of control provided by our system, farmers that tend to a wide
      variety of crops can grow genetically modified crops without worrying about
      them encroaching on their wild type counterparts. Feel free to visit the Implementation
      page to learn more </li>
