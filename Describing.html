  <h3 class="h3"> Goals </h3>
  <p class="p"> We hope that the modeling approaches mentioned in this section provide a better understanding of describing the mechanisms behind our biological system and what it hopes to accomplish. This section may also shed light (heh) on some aspects of apoptosis that have been unknown or not well-characterized in literature.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h3"> Boolean </h3>
  <p class="p">With lack of experimental data accessible to our team this year, we turned to graphical schemes. Graphical schemes are often utilized to relate and establish cause-effect relationships. The apoptotic pathways found in plant and animal cells involve a complex network of many signaling pathways. Using Boolean logic, we can capture the qualitative behavior of our construct on target tissue to provide a comprehensive description of the specific apoptosis network. Here, proteins will be depicted by nodes and their activities will be described through states (ON/OFF) and logical operations (AND/OR/NOT). We will build a literature-based Boolean model that will depict our construct’s response to the stimuli of light (740-780 nm). Furthermore, we hope to incorporate CellNetAnalyzer, a MATLAB toolbox that provides a graphical user interface and room for computational methods, algorithms, and simulations. Through this, we can determine the structural and functional properties of our network.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h3"> ODEs </h3>
  <p class="p">One of the main chemical reactions that will be of use to our project is gene regulation. Through the use of ODEs, we will be able to model the following processes: DNA binding and unbinding, transcription and translation, degradation of protein and mRNA, dimerization, and multimerization.
	Furthermore, transcription factors are constantly shuttled in and out of the nucleus to regulate the genes they correspond to. We will focus on modeling the shuttling rates of BphP1 and Q-PAS1 by monitoring ODEs. There are two variables that will be of importance to us: the amount BphP1-Q-PAS1 in the cytoplasm and the amount in the nucleus. Transitions will be outlined as cytoplasm to the nucleus and vice versa. These rates will then be analyzed to determine any correlations between the import-export ratios.
	Additionally, we would like to use ODEs to understand the difference between basal conditions and residual conditions. Basal conditions refer to how much of our bax protein is present in complete darkness. This pertains to the leakage and promoter strength specific to each promoter. Modeling the number of sites would also be useful, as leakage decreases as the number of sites increase in a repressor system. With regards to residual conditions, or how much bax protein stays in the cytosol and/or mitochondria after there is no longer a light stimulus present, we would use ODEs to measure the concentration of bax protein in both the cytosol and mitochondria throughout a unit of time.
	Using the aperture differential equation, we can model ion diffusion out of the mitochondria. This will model mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which is caused by the formation of the MAC.
	Allele frequencies, comparing the base rates and our system’s rates of how plants distribute their alleles, will also be modeled. Ideally, the rate of distribution of alleles after the implementation of our system will be much lower than base rates.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h3"> PDEs and CA </h3>
  <p class="p">Commonly used for studying protein networks in response to stochastic fluctuations and spatial dependencies, cellular automata (CA) have gained popularity to describe the nature of cellular processes. CA describe protein changes at specific locations and time points. They also portray the dynamic behaviour of a system by dividing the spatial regimes into grids. Proteins are assigned a likelihood of diffusion, or thresholds, that let the protein diffuse to neighboring grids if it crosses a particular number. We will model the mitochondrial membrane in an equally spaced grid of 100x100 compartments. Each grid will be assigned a limited number of proteins, which will all be given a diffusion probability. Reactions will be defined by rules and all reaction partners will be co-located on the same grid. Then, we can analyze the results somehow. This entire paragraph was plagiarized from a paper I read.
We hope to integrate PDEs and CA to simulate the formation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC). With our current knowledge, it takes 9 Bax proteins to oligomerize and form a 5.5-6 nm hole in the outer mitochondrial membrane. With this information, we can model how long and in which location it takes to form the MAC, and perhaps even how many channels guarantee cell death.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h3"> Conclusion </h3>
  <p class="p"> Computational models have and continue to provide important insights into biological processes. The methods described in this section aim to describe the mechanisms behind the system in a concise manner. Currently, knowledge of mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptosis signalling is lacking in literature. We hope that the methods mentioned above will contribute significantly to the understanding of the role of mitochondria in cell death.
