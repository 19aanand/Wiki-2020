            </h2>
            <p>
                While unable to do much wetlab ths year, our team will work in a
                laboratory in the Center for Molecular Medicine at Stony Brook University. Our lab
                is Biosafety Level-1 and has class IIA2 biosafety cabinet. Each team member is required to have
                the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) such as nitrile gloves, ANSI Z87.1 safety goggles, long
                pants and lab coats. Stony Brook University has mandated waste disposal procedures to properly
                dispose of biohazardous waste and liquid waste produced by experiments

                Our Training
            </h2>
            <p>
                In preparation for wetlab work, all members of the Stony Brook iGEM team must complete a
                 <a href = "https://about.citiprogram.org/en/series/responsible-conduct-of-research-rcr/">Collaborative institutional Training initiative (CITI) 
                 </a>
                on responsible conduct of research. Stony Brook safety courses are required as well to teach students waste disposal and different hazards.
                These courses include dealing with hazardous wasts (ENV 001), chemical hazards (ELS 002), biological hazards (ELS 003), and regulated medical
                waste (ENV 005). More information on these courses can be found <a href = "https://ehs.stonybrook.edu//services/training/training-course-list-and-descriptions#LabSafety"> here </a>

                Safety and Ethical Concerns
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our experiemnts are closely tied to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Therefore,
                there are some ethical concerns that must be addressed. Preservation of native species
                is a primary goal of our work, focusing on limiting gene flow if/when GMO organisms escape 
                greenhouses into the natural environment...(tbc as we continue the project)
