                <h1>The Problem</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For a number of decades, the agricultural industry has sought to enact the 
                    benefits of genetically modified (GM) crops to improve crop yields and mitigate
                    crop losses due to pests and pathogens. GM crops can decrease pesticide usage in 
                    large-scale agricultural production[1] and uptake nutrients more efficiently than 
                    their unmodified counterparts[2]. 
                    <br><br>
                    While genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have 
                    revolutionized the current worldview of agriculture, farmers and scientists alike 
                    have raised concerns over their negative effects on the environment. 
                    Particularly, gene flow—the transfer of genetic variation from one population to 
                    another—from cultivated crops to weedy or wild crops is a potential risk of 
                    commercializing GM crops. 
                    <br><br>
                    Gene flow can decrease genetic variation within a 
                    population by modifying allele frequencies[3]. 
                    If the rate of gene flow is high enough, GM crops can outcompete their 
                    wild-type (WT) counterparts, leading to decreased biodiversity. 
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <h1>Biodiversity's Importance</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Agricultural biodiversity,” or agrobiodiversity, consists of animals, plants, 
                    and microorganisms at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels are necessary 
                    to sustain key functions in the agro-system[4]. Generally, greater biodiversity 
                    enables agricultural productivity over a wider range of conditions[5]. 
                    In light of climate change, maintaining agrobiodiversity is necessary to ensure 
                    the resilience of food crop production. 
                    <br><br>
                    The 1800s Irish potato famine highlights the importance of agrobiodiversity[6]. 
                    The lack of genetic variability in the potatoes proved detrimental when the 
                    pathogen, P. infestans, wiped out the entire population. This lack of genetic 
                    variability is seen today; 7,000 plant species are used for human consumption, 
                    yet four crops provide half of the global plant-based energy intake and 15 crops 
                    contribute another two-thirds[5].
                    <br><br>
                    As the popularity of GMOs increases, concerns that they could reduce the 
                    biodiversity of the agricultural landscape and surrounding ecosystems also 
                    increase. The effectiveness of herbicide-resistant crops have eliminated 
                    milkweeds from many fields. However, the loss of milkweed harms insects like the 
                    monarch butterfly, which has experienced a population decline of about 80% in the 
                    last two decades[7]. Therefore, our project seeks an innovative solution to the 
                    consequences of GM crops while still reaping their benefits.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <h1>Indoor Farming - An Incomplete Solution</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are many prospective solutions to combat gene flow and its impact on 
                    agriculture. One is vertical farming, which involves cultivating produce in 
                    vertically arranged layers. It has paved the way for sustainable agricultural 
                    practices, allowing farmers and agricultural industries greater control over 
                    factors like soil and water use, and gas emission levels[8].
                    <br><br>
                    With hydroponic farming methods, farmers can introduce oxygen and other nutrients 
                    to plant roots, allowing for more growth cycles in less time. Traditional farming 
                    methods rely on nitrogen-containing fertilizers, which increase the amount of 
                    atmospheric nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Growing produce in an indoor 
                    environment gives farmers more control over their crops and prevents intervention 
                    from animals, pathogens, and even other plants—reducing gene flow. 
                    <br><br>
                    Indoor vertical farming is an effective strategy for promoting conservation and 
                    minimizing gene flow that could occur in conventional farming methods. 
                    However, this strategy lacks control at the level of an individual organism 
                    if it were to be inadvertently introduced to the environment.
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <h1>Hypersensitive Response</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Programmed cell death (PCD) is a common process that occurs in many organisms 
                    during development in response to environmental or biotic stimuli. One of the 
                    best characterized forms of PCD in animals is called apoptosis. However, plant 
                    cell death is not characterized as apoptosis, because plant cell death 
                    mechanisms lack some of its hallmarks. Namely, lack of caspase proteins, 
                    a major player in a cell’s commitment to apoptosis, and the inability to 
                    participate in phagocytosis due to a rigid cell wall is why controlled 
                    processes of plant cell death are referred to as PCD rather than apoptosis[9].
                    <br><br>
                    Instead, plants participate in a different pathway of programmed cell death 
                    known as the hypersensitive response (HR). It should be noted that, much like 
                    apoptotic mechanisms are not identical across all animals, HR in plants is also 
                    not exact across the board. Though it is not nearly as well characterized, the 
                    hallmarks of HR are strikingly similar to those found in animal apoptosis. 
                    Comparable features include cytoplasmic shrinkage, cytochrome c release, 
                    mitochondrial swelling, chromatin condensation, and loss of mitochondrial 
                    membrane potential. Additionally, plant cells undergo formation of large 
                    vesicles, disruption of the cytoskeleton and the cessation of cytoplasmic 
                    streaming during HR[10].
                </p>

                <br><br>
                <h1>Bax and the Hypersensitive Response</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family. Among other processes, these 
                    proteins regulate pathways associated with apoptosis. Bcl-2 proteins can 
                    either be pro-apoptotic and work to induce apoptosis (like Bax/Bak), or 
                    anti-apoptotic and work to inhibit apoptosis (like Bcl-2 proteins).
                    Bax is crucial for the assembly of a structure called the mitochondrial 
                    apoptosis-induced channel (MAC)[13]. This structure is a channel in the 
                    outer membrane of the mitochondria (OMM) that releases proteins that reside 
                    in the intermembrane space. In response to apoptotic-inducing insults, Bax, 
                    the pro-apoptotic protein, translocates from the cytosol to the OMM. 
                    <br><br>
                    Once associated with the OMM, Bax oligomerizes and forms the mitochondrial 
                    apoptosis-induced channel (MAC). This protein interacts with and increases 
                    the opening of the mitochondrial voltage-gated anion channel (VDAC), which 
                    leads to loss in membrane potential. This subsequently releases cytochrome c, 
                    which triggers the permeabilization of OMM via the release of Smac1, 
                    and ultimately the activation of a caspase cascade, a key event in committing 
                    the cell to undergoing apoptosis through intrinsic pathways in animal cells[14].
                    <br><br> 
                    Although not endogenous to plants, Bax can be expressed (crucially, overexpressed) 
                    in plant tissues, ultimately resulting in HR-like cell death. It has been 
                    suggested that this is due to the integration of Bax into the mitochondrial 
                    membrane, however, Bax expression associated with HR is not well characterized 
                    in plants.
